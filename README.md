## my project
i would like to develop a program that would help put together an individual yoga sequence. a student would enter how much time she has for a practice, what is her overall level, what should be the emphasis of the practice, and whether particular asanas should not be used. based on this information the programm would output a list of asanas (maybe with pictures or additional instructions) that the student can follow through her practice.
